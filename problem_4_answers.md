The resulting visualization has less features, but I implemented the 2 main things - which is have the time axis always zoom to the correct scale to include everything. The other is a keyword search - you can type into the text box to search for commits that have certain keywords in their comments. Another file documents a slider which is not working correctly yet. that file is called problem_4_slidernotworking.html
